This repository contains the implementation of SCFR, a generative facial video compression framework based on sparse compact feature representation.

1.  Please download the RGB444 and YUV420 testing sequences from the official JVET GFVC repository: [https://vcgit.hhi.fraunhofer.de/jvet-ahg-gfvc/gfvc_v1]. After downloading, rename the test sequences according to the VOXCELEB and CFVQA formats used in our project.
2.  Download our **SCFR** model and the **Depth** Estimation model from the following link: [https://pan.quark.cn/s/3efd2736e284.]
3.  run: Python RUN.py.
4.  Navigate to the evaluate/ directory and run the evaluation scripts to obtain the final compression results.
